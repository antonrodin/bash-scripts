Some bash scripts and amazon cli cmds
=====================================

They are not very useful, I shoudnt loose them because they have some headers. That headers, they some kind of 
pain in the ass, because of pagespeed and GtMetrix.

Also some basic Amazon CLI Commands... for example bash script for clear cloudfront cache, very useful. Founded on stackoverflow site.
